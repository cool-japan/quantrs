## Architecture Highlights

### DAG-Based Optimization
The DAG representation enables powerful circuit optimizations:
- Dependency-aware gate reordering
- Automatic parallelization detection
- Critical path optimization
- Circuit depth minimization

### Commutation-Aware Scheduling
The commutation analyzer integrates with:
- DAG layer optimization
- Slice parallelization
- Gate reordering passes

### Modular Design
Each component is self-contained:
- DAG can be used independently
- Commutation rules are extensible
- QASM support is version-agnostic
- Slicing strategies are pluggable

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient graph algorithms (O(V+E) complexity)
- Cached commutation lookups
- Lazy evaluation where possible
- Memory-efficient representations

## Integration Points

### With Existing Circuit Module
- Seamlessly integrates with Circuit<N> builder
- Compatible with existing optimization passes
- Enhances graph_optimizer functionality

### With Other QuantRS2 Modules
- Can export to simulator formats
- Device-aware slicing for hardware
- QASM interoperability with other tools

## Testing Summary

Total tests implemented: **21 tests**
- All tests passing
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases
- Performance validated for large circuits

## Future Enhancements

While the core functionality is complete, future work could include:
- QASM 3.0 full implementation
- GPU-accelerated DAG algorithms
- Machine learning-based slicing
- Advanced commutation with phases
- Real-time circuit visualization

## Usage Examples

```rust
use quantrs2_circuit::prelude::*;

// Create and analyze a circuit
let mut circuit = Circuit::<4>::new();
circuit.h(0).cnot(0, 1).h(2).cnot(2, 3);

// Convert to DAG
let dag = circuit_to_dag(&circuit);
println!("Circuit depth: {}", dag.max_depth());

// Analyze commutation
let analyzer = CommutationAnalyzer::new();
let matrix = analyzer.build_commutation_matrix(circuit.gates());

// Export to QASM
let qasm = export_qasm(&circuit, QasmVersion::V2_0);
println!("{}", qasm);

// Slice for parallel execution
let slicer = CircuitSlicer::new();
let slices = slicer.slice_circuit(&circuit, SlicingStrategy::MaxQubits(2));

// Topological analysis
let topo = circuit.topological_analysis();
println!("Critical path length: {}", topo.critical_path.len());
