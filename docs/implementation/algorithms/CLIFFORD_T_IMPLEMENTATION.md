# Clifford+T Gate Decomposition Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Clifford+T gate decomposition in the QuantRS2-Core module. The Clifford+T gate set is fundamental in quantum computing as it forms a universal gate set that can approximate any single-qubit unitary operation to arbitrary precision.

## Implementation Details

### File: `core/src/decomposition/clifford_t.rs`

### Key Components

#### 1. Gate Representations
- **`CliffordGate`**: Enum representing the 6 Clifford gates (H, S, S†, X, Y, Z)
- **`CliffordTGate`**: Enum representing either a Clifford gate or T/T† gate
- **`CliffordTSequence`**: A sequence of Clifford+T gates with T-count tracking

#### 2. Main Decomposer
- **`CliffordTDecomposer`**: The main struct that performs decomposition
  - Grid-based approximation approach
  - Exact synthesis for special cases (Clifford gates, T powers)
  - Caching of decomposition results

#### 3. Key Algorithms

##### Exact Synthesis
- Detects if input is already a Clifford gate
- Checks for gates of the form Clifford · T^k · Clifford
- Returns exact decompositions when possible

##### Grid-Based Approximation
- Pre-computes a grid of Clifford+T sequences up to a certain T-count
- Finds the closest grid point to the target unitary
- Trade-off between grid size and approximation quality

##### Sequence Optimization
- Cancels adjacent inverse gates (e.g., T·T† = I)
- Combines multiple S gates (S·S = Z)
- Minimizes overall sequence length

#### 4. T-Count Optimization
- Tracks T-count throughout decomposition
- Provides methods for T-count constrained decomposition
- Important for NISQ devices where T gates are expensive

## API Usage

```rust
use quantrs2_core::prelude::*;

// Create a decomposer with precision ε = 10^-6
let mut decomposer = CliffordTDecomposer::new(1e-6);

// Decompose an arbitrary 2×2 unitary
let unitary = /* some unitary matrix */;
let sequence = decomposer.decompose(&unitary.view())?;

// Get the T-count
println!("T-count: {}", sequence.t_count);

// Convert to gate operations
let qubit = QubitId(0);
let gates = sequence.to_gates(qubit);

// Optimize with T-count constraint
let optimized = decomposer.decompose_optimal(&unitary.view(), Some(5))?;
```

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Grid Coverage**: The current grid-based approach has limited coverage for arbitrary rotations
2. **Approximation Quality**: For general unitaries not close to grid points, approximation error can be significant
3. **Scalability**: Grid size grows exponentially with T-count limit

### Future Improvements
1. **Matsumoto-Amano Algorithm**: Implement the exact synthesis algorithm for better coverage
2. **Database Approach**: Use pre-computed databases of optimal sequences
3. **Machine Learning**: Use ML techniques to predict good initial approximations
4. **Parallelization**: Parallelize grid search for better performance

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Exact Clifford gate detection
- T-gate counting
- Sequence optimization
- Approximation accuracy for gates in the grid

## Integration

The module is fully integrated with the QuantRS2 framework:
- Exports through the prelude
- Compatible with existing gate operations
- Works with the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for comparison

## Performance Considerations

- Grid initialization is done once at decomposer creation
- Caching prevents redundant computations
- Sequence optimization reduces final gate count
- Matrix operations use efficient ndarray/BLAS routines
