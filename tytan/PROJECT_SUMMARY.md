# QuantRS2-Tytan Quantum Optimization Framework

## Executive Summary

QuantRS2-Tytan is a cutting-edge quantum optimization library that combines the power of quantum annealing with classical optimization techniques to solve complex combinatorial problems. Built on Rust's performance foundation and inspired by the Python Tytan library, it delivers state-of-the-art performance while maintaining an intuitive API for both researchers and practitioners.

The framework excels at solving QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) and HOBO (Higher-Order Binary Optimization) problems, providing a comprehensive toolkit that scales from small academic problems to industrial-scale optimization challenges with thousands of variables.
