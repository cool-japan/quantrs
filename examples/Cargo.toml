# Feature for simulation examples which require quantrs-sim
#
# Examples are divided into two categories:
# 1. Quantum annealing examples (max_cut, graph_coloring, traveling_salesman)
#    - These don't require any special features
#    - Run with: cargo run --bin max_cut
#
# 2. Quantum simulation examples (bell_state, optimized_sim_small)
#    - These require the "simulation" feature which enables quantrs-sim dependency
#    - Run with: cargo run --features simulation --bin bell_state
